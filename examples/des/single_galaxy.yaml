# Modified blend.yaml for a simulation of a single galaxy or minimal blending.

modules:
    # Keep the same custom modules for blending and log-normal distribution
    - blend
    - log_normal

psf:
    # Using Moffat PSF, but with smaller FWHM for sharper images
    type: Moffat
    fwhm: 0.3    # Reduced FWHM for sharper point spread function (was 0.5)
    beta: 3.0    # Keep the same beta value
    index_key: file_num  # The PSF changes per output file

gal:
    # Simple Exponential galaxy (no changes here)
    type: Exponential

        mean: 1.0    # Reduced size of galaxy for sharper appearance (was 1.2)
        sigma: 0.3   # Reduced sigma to limit variation in galaxy size (was 0.4)

        eta1: { type: RandomGaussian, sigma: 0.15 }  # Less ellipticity for a more regular shape

    flux:
        type: LogNormal
        mean: 1500.   # Reduced flux for more realistic brightness (was 2000)
        sigma: 400.   # Adjusted sigma to control variation (was 500)

stamp:
    # Custom stamp type for blending. To simulate fewer neighbors or no neighbors:
    type: Blend

    # Reduced number of neighbors for less blending or set to 0 for single galaxies.
    n_neighbors:
        type: RandomBinomial
        N: 2  # Reduce max number of neighbors from 5 to 2
        p: 0.2  # Lower probability of neighbors (was 0.3)

    # Adjust the separation ranges for galaxies
    min_sep: 3   # Increase minimum separation to reduce overlapping (was 2)
    max_sep: 8   # Reduce maximum separation to keep galaxies close enough (was 10)
